# iot-firmware-boilerplate
Raspberry Pi Raspbian-based Kiosk Web system for IoT devices.

Use your favorite frontend framework with your choice of backend programming to create interactive Kiosk applications that have full, native system access. A python webview is used to bridge the gap.

## Features

- Automatically login, update, and run your app on boot.
- Single install script takes care of setup, installation, and drivers.

## Usage

With a fresh Raspberry Pi running RaspberryPi OS (Raspbian):

- Open terminal or ssh in (if you've already enabled it)
- Run: `bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lacymorrow/iot-starter/main/install.sh)`

## Under the hood:

- Installs `git`
- Clones this repo
- Changes password to `pi` (Username is also `pi`)
- Changes splash screen
- Setup raspi-config wifi
- Enables SSH
- Adds boot config for attached display
- Adds boot script (`User pi autostart`)

## Workflow

- Copy the static build to the `out` folder
- (On the Raspberry Pi) Run `sudo git -C /home/pi/firmware pull` to update the firmware

### Handy Commands:

- `sudo git -C /home/pi/firmware pull` to update the firmware
- `sudo python /home/pi/firmware/apps/firmware/drivers/temperhum/temperhum.py` to test the temperature and humidity sensor
- `sudo bash /home/pi/firmware/apps/firmware/bin/init` to run the app
- `sudo bash /home/pi/firmware/apps/firmware/bin/setup/update.sh` to update the system
- `sudo tail -f /proc/PID/fd/1` to see the logs
- `sudo kill -9 PID` to kill the process
- `sudo reboot 0` to reboot the system
